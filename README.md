# red_wine_quality  
## Overview  

**Objectives:** To predict the quality rating of a sampling of red wines.  
**The Dataset:** The dataset comes from the [Kaggle Red Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). This dataset is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) from the UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository and posted on Kaggle by [UCI Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/organizations/uciml). The data come from the paper [Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physiochemical properties](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Modeling-wine-preferences-by-data-mining-from-Cortez-Cerdeira/bf15a0ccc14ac1deb5cea570c870389c16be019c) by Cortez, Cerdeira, et. al.  

## Tools Used:
